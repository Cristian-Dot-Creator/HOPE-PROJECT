To look at this site you first have to open your terminal 
cd yourself into the Hope Blog folder then cd into dev-blog 
once in dev-blog


type into the terminal     turbo devserver 

then go into an empty webpage and paste this into the url http://localhost:3000/

This is something We could possible do. Not exactly this but something along the lines of this type of blog site.
