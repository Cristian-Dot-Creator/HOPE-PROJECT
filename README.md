# Future Plans 
We plan to create an API that allows you to upload files to the Blog , We know some of our users will already have their own Documents written out. We want those user to have the ablitly to upload and share thier experiences as well. Creating a data base that stores all these new posted blogs and uploaded files is Also one of our future goals.
